            December 9 is the birthday of what pioneering computer scientist who served as a rear admiral in the
            United States Navy? She was also instrumental in the creation of the COBOL programming language.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Grace Hopper</span></p>

                <p class="details">In 1947 Hopper and her team discovered a moth lodged in one of the components of the
                    computer they were using, preventing it from working correctly. For that reason she is often
                    credited with coining the word "debugging" to mean finding and fixing the errors in a computer system,
                    though in all likelihood the word was in use before this incident.</p>

            Lots of irritating single parentheses are a feature of what list processing language that is an
            ancestor of both LOGO and Scheme?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Lisp</span></p>

                <p class="details">Layers and layers of nested parentheses are a distinctive feature of Lisp. Here is
                typical example of Lisp code:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-lisp">
(defun factorial (n)
    (if (= n 0) 1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
            </code></pre>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Computers can represent numbers several different ways. In the binary system numbers are represented using
            powers of 2. Another system, hexadecimal, uses powers of what number?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">16</span></p>

                <p class="details">Hexadecimal needs 16 different digits, so 0 - 9 are used as usual and the letters A -
                    F are used to represent the quantities 10 - 15. For example, the hexadecimal value 3C
                    equals 60 since the 3 means three 16s and the C means twelve 1s, and 3 &times; 16 + 12 &times; 1 = 60.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) code below will make a web page with what color background?

            <pre><code class="language-css">
body {
    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
}
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>blue</code></span></p>

                <p class="details">The 'r', 'g', and 'b' in <code>rgb()</code> stand for red, green, and blue. <code>rgb(0,
                    0, 255)</code> means a color that is all blue with no red or green. <code>rgb(255, 0, 255)</code>
                    would be purple (actually pinkish purple) since that's what you get when you mix red and blue.</p>
