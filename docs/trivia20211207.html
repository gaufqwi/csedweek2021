        <li>
            What English computer scientist is considered the inventor of the World Wide Web?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Tim Berners-Lee</span></p>

                <p class="details">Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989. He wrote the first browser in 1990 while
                    employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The first website, which was about the web itself, was
                    published on 20 December 1990.</p>

        <li>
            What computer language is named for a 17th century French mathematician? This man also lends his name to
            a famous triangle that is important in mathematics.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Pascal</span></p>

                <p class="details">The Pascal programming language was designed by Niklaus Wirth. Popular in the
                    1970s, it has largely been replaced by C. The triangle mentioned is called Pascal's Triangle,
                    named for mathematician Blaise Pascal.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Almost all modern computer chips are made primarily from what chemical element with atomic number 14?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Silicon</span></p>

                <p class="details">Silicon is a semiconductor, meaning that it can transmit an electrical current, but
                    not as easily as a metal. By adding small amounts of other elements to a silicon chip, engineers
                    can change its properties to create switches and other types of circuits.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What string does the Javascript code below print?

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
console.log('3' + '5')
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>35</code></span></p>

                <p class="details"><code>'3'</code> and <code>'5'</code> may look like the numbers 3 and 5, but because they are in quotes they are actually strings. In Javascript, the <code>+</code> operator applied to two strings concatenates them, i.e. joins them together. That is true even if the strings happen to look like numbers.</p>
