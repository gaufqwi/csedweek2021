            What Stanford computer scientist literally wrote the book on computer algorithms: the multi-volume work
            in progress called <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>? You might think the first letter of his last
            name is silent, but it isn't.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Donald Knuth</span></p>

                <p class="details">Knuth also wrote the TeX typesetting system that is still widely used for
                scientific and mathematical papers. If you find an error in one his books he will send you a
                check for $2.56.</p>

        <li>
            What object-oriented computer language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid 1990s? It is named
            for a beverage popular among programmers who work late into the night.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Java</span></p>

                <p class="details">Java was designed to compile into "bytecode" rather than machine code. That means
                that the same Java program can run on any computer - Mac, PC, Unix, etc. - without any changes.</p>
            </div>

            Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on a kind of database that stores data in an ordered
            list of records on many, many computers spread all around the world. What is the two word name of
            that type of database?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">block chain</span></p>

                <p class="details">The trick to making a block chain system work is getting everyone to agree on the
                same data. Bitcoin does this by forcing anyone who wants to participate to solve a hard mathematical
                problem. That makes it hard to cheat the system as long a majority of people are playing fair.</p>

            What number will the following Swift program print out?

            <pre><code class="language-swift">
let numbers = [12, 5, 7, 15, 2, 9]
var sum = 0

for n in numbers {
    if n < 10 {
        sum = sum + n
    }
}
print(sum)
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">23</span></p>

                <p class="details">The <code>for</code> loop repeats for each number in the list. Because
                of the <code>if</code> statement, only the numbers less than 10 get added to <code>sum</code>. So
                <code>sum</code> will equal 5 + 7 + 2 + 9, which is 23.</p>
