    <h1>Coding Puzzles</h1>

    <p>People can turn anything into a contest: <a href="https://www.thewssa.com/">cup stacking</a>, <a href="https://nathansfranks.smithfieldfoods.com/en-us/promotions/hot-dog-eating-contest/">hot dog eating</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/jul/18/bee-bearding-contest-china">bee wearing</a>, anything. So it shouldn't surprise you to learn that there is such thing as competitive programming. Some programming contests involve intense head to head competition between two or more programmers (or teams). Others are more puzzle-like and are more about challenging yourself to come up with the best solution possible to a given problem. Two of my favorites are <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. Project Euler runs year round, with new challenges added all the time. The early ones are pretty easy, but they get challenging fast. Advent of Code posts a pair of linked challenges from December 1 to 25 each year. These tend to be a little more whimsical and fun, and probably easier to approach for new programmers, though they do get tougher as the month goes on.</p>

    <p>Since we are right in the middle of Advent of Code, I thought I would share one of my solutions with you. Spoiler alert, of course, but if you want a taste of what Advent of Code is about, check out the video below.
