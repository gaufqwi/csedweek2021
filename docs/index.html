    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hi there. Welcome to whatever this is.</p>

    <p>Actually, I can tell you what this is. I taught middle school for 20 years. For the last five years of that my
        absolute favorite time of year was <a href="https://www.csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a>. The
        <a
                href="https://hourofcode.com/">Hour of Code</a> was always fun, of course, but I also enjoyed
        providing trivia questions and other activities for our students and faculty. Since I'm not in the classroom
        anymore I don't get to do that now and that makes me sad. So decided to make my own fun and put up some
        CSEdWeek activities right here.</p>

    <p>To be a little more specific, my goal for this little project is to offer computer science trivia questions every
        day
        as well as a series of tutorials on creating a simple platformer type game with Javascript. If I can think of
        anything else, then I'll share that too.</p>
