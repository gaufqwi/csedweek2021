    <h1>Sandboxes for Programming</h1>

    <p>On the playground a sandbox is place to play where you can make your own fun. There is sand there that you can dig through and build with, and some walls to keep the sand in so you don't make a big mess, but that's pretty much it. You get to decide what you want to imagine and create in the sandbox.</p>

    <p>In the world of programming a sandbox is pretty similar. The word actually can refer to a couple of different things, but for our purposes a sandbox is an environment where you can write and run code right in your web browser. That means you can get started coding without having to install anything on your computer. Sandboxes are the perfect way to learn about and experiment with different programming languages. They are also great if you just want to write some code quickly to solve a problem or a puzzle. More on programming puzzles later in the week.</p>

    <p>Here are some of my favorite coding sandboxes for different languages. Some of these are designed for beginners and some are intended for use by more experienced programmers.</p>

    <table class="sandboxes">
        <tr class="language"><td colspan="2">Block-based Programming</td></tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/">Scratch</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                You may have encountered Scratch before through a guided Hour of Code activity, but the Scratch editor will let you create your projects from, well, scratch.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                App Inventor is a block-based environment for creating and testing apps that run on phones and other mobile devices.

            <td class="link"><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html">Snap!</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                Snap! is a block-based environment designed for more experienced programmers. It has some features that Scratch does not.
            </td>

        <tr class="language"><td colspan="2">Python</td></tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="http://www.pythonsandbox.com/">Python Sandbox</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                The name says it all. A simple sandbox for text-based Python programs.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://codehs.com/editor/sandbox/explore/python">Code HS</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                CodeHS provides several different Python sandbox environments. Some are purely text-based and others provide different kinds of graphics. Check out the examples and see which one works best for you.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="language"><td colspan="2">Javascript</td></tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs">Khan Academy</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                Khan Academy's Javascript sandbox is great for drawing and animation.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/">P5.js</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                P5 is very similar to Khan Academy in that it provides lots of Javascript functions for creating graphics. It is more powerful and gives you more options, but the tradeoff is that it is a little harder to get started.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                JSFiddle lets you use Javascript to do what the language was originally designed for, creating interactive web pages. That means that you will probably need to write HTML and maybe CSS code as well.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="language"><td colspan="2">Java</td></tr>
        <tr class="entry">
            <td class="link"><a href="https://codehs.com/editor/sandbox/explore/java">Code HS</a></td>
            <td class="desc">
                Java is an important language because it is used in AP Computer Science courses (and for other reasons too). There aren't too many sandboxes for Java available, but CodeHS has a good one.
