            What is the name of the Finnish-American computer scientist who created the open source Unix-like operating
            system that is at the core of many web servers, mobile phones, and other devices? He shares his name with
            both a Nobel prize-winning chemist and a blanket-carrying cartoon character.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Linus Torvalds</span></p>

                <p class="details">Torvalds started writing the Linux operating system in 1991 as a way to learn
                about the Intel 386 computer chip. He also wrote the Git version control system that used by
                developers all over the world.</p>

            What language was introduced by Apple in 2014 as a replacement for Objective-C? If you want to write iOS

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Swift</span></p>

                <p class="details">Swift borrows features from lots of other programming languages such as C#,
                Python, Ruby, and others. In 2015 it became open source, which means that anyone can see the code
                and contribute to improving it.</p>

        <li>
            Many acronyms related to computer networking and the internet end with the letter P. Examples include
            IP, TCP, DHCP, and HTTP. What word does the letter P stand for in each of these acronyms?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">protocol</span></p>

                <p class="details">A protocol is a common set of rules for interacting and communicating shared among
                a group of people (or computers). These protocols ensure that computers "speak the same language"
                when they exchange data over the network.</p>

        <li>
            In the complete C program shown below, which of the three functions would be the first (and in fact
            only) to be called when the program is run?

            <pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

init() {
   printf("Hello, World from init!");
}

start() {
   printf("Hello, World from start!");
}

main() {
   printf("Hello, World from main!");
}
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>main()</code></span></p>

                <p class="details">C, developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s, is the most popular programming
                language in the world. The <code>main()</code> function is the entry point for C programs.</p>
