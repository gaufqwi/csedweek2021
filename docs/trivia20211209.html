            What is the name of the British-American computer scientist who is the chief designer of the technical
            computing software Mathematica and whose company runs a computational knowledge engine called Alpha?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Stephen Wolfram</span></p>

                <p class="details">WolframAlpha can solve lots of problems involving science and math. For example,
                    it can graph equations and give step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems.</p>

            What common business oriented language was based on work done by Admiral Grace Hopper? Important during
            the 1960s and 1970s, this language is much less widely used today, though some mainframe systems still
            depend on it.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">COBOL</span></p>

                <p class="details">Grace Hopper is one of the most important pioneers in the field of computer science.
                    Today (December 9) is her birthday.</p>

            A byte is a small unit of computer data, more or less equivalent to a single character. What is half of a
            byte called?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">a nibble</span></p>

                <p class="details">The very smallest unit of data a computer can work with is a single binary digit
                    or "bit". Each bit can be either 0 or 1. There are 8 bits in a byte, so there are four bits in
                    a nibble.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What number is printed out by the C program shown below?

            <pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() {
    int i, old, current, previous;

    previous = 0;
    current = 1;

    for (i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
        old = current;
        current = current + previous;
        previous = old;
    }
    printf("%i", current);
}

            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>13</code></span></p>

                <p class="details">Each time through the loop the <code>current</code> variable is replaced by its
                    sum with the previous value. The loop repeats six times, so if you trace through carefully you
                    will see that <code>current</code> goes through the values of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and, finally 13. You
                    may recognize these numbers as the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
