            What 18th century mathematician and engineer designed the Difference Engine and the Analytical engine, thought to be the first digital programmable computers?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Charles Babbage</span></p>

                <p class="details">Babbages "computers" were mechanical, not electronic. Though neither was constructed
                    during his lifetime, since then working models have been built from his designs.</p>

            What C-like language with a two letter name was designed at Google in the late 2000s?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Go</span></p>

                <p class="details">Notable projects written in Go include the Docker and Kubernetes container systems
                    and CockroachDB, a scalable database.</p>

            Broadly speaking, modern computer processors can be divided into RISC and CISC types. RISC stands for
            "reduced instruction-set computer". What does CISC stand for?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">complex instruction-set computer</span></p>

                <p class="details">CISC processors generally support more powerful instructions than RISC processors,
                    but each instruction might require more time or energy to execute, so it is really impossible to
                    say that one type is always better than the other.</p>

            What number will the following Swift program print out?

            <pre><code class="language-swift">
let numbers = [12, 5, 7, 15, 2, 9]
var sum = 0

for n in numbers {
    if n*n > 50 {
        sum = sum + n
    }
}
print(sum)
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">36</span></p>

                <p class="details">The <code>for</code> loop repeats for each number in the list. Because
                of the <code>if</code> statement, only the numbers whose square is greater than 50 get added to
                    <code>sum</code>. So <code>sum</code> will equal 12 + 15 + 9, which is 36.</p>
