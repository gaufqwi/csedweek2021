    <h1>Cellular Automata</h1>

    <p>In the late 1960s mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton
        Conway</a> invented the <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/">Game of Life</a>. The Game of Life isn't really
        game so much as it is a kind of dynamic model. The idea is that you have a rectangular grid of "cells" that at
        any given time are either "alive" or "dead". Then over time new cells are born and old ones die, all based on
        simple rules based on the cell's current state and the state of its neighbors. This type of model is called
        a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a> (plural automata). Even
        though the rules are simple, cellular automata can produce all kinds of complex and surprising behavior.
        They can even be used to simulate a general purpose computer!</p>

    <p>I was inspired by one of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24">old Advent of Code problems</a> to
        create my own cellular automaton. The problem described a floor made of black and white hexagonal tiles that
        changed from moment to moment based on the following rules:</p>

    <ul class="rules">
        <li>Any black tile with zero or more than 2 black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to white.</li>
        <li>Any white tile with exactly 2 black tiles immediately adjacent to it is flipped to black.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can play with the hex automaton below. Click on the hexes to toggle them between black and white, then
        click "Run" to see how the pattern evolves according to the rules. It's a pretty simplistic version of the
        model and it has some limitations. In particular, ideally cellular automata are supposed to have infinite
        room to grow, but this one can't grow past the edge of the screen. There are still plenty of cells to see
        some interesting patterns. Give it a try.</p>
