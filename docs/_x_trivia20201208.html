    <p>Give these trivia questions a try. Click the blurry text to see the answers.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What 19th century woman is often considered to be the world's first computer programmer? She wrote a
            program to calculate a mathematical sequence called the Bernoulli numbers.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Ada Lovelace</span></p>

                <p class="details">The mechanical computer that Ada's program was intended to run on, Charles Babbage's
                    Analytical engine, was never built, so she never got a chance to test her program. Still, she
                    deserves major credit for her insights on how computers could be used as general purpose problem
                    solving machines, not just calculators for arithmetic.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What computer language invented by Guido van Rossum was named for a British comedy troupe?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Python</span></p>

                <p class="details">The comedy troupe was Monty Python, who had a TV program and made several movies.
                    Today Python is one of the most popular computer languages around the world. It was
                    designed to be easy to learn yet still powerful.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What line of inexpensive, credit card sized computers popular with hobbyists is named for a fruit and
            a mathematical constant?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Raspberry Pi</span></p>

                <p class="details">Raspberry Pi computers aren't just for fun. In Brazil they are being used to
                run ventilators used by COVID patients.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What string does the Javascript code below print?

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'orange', 'pear'];
console.log(fruits[3]);
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>'orange'</code></span></p>

                <p class="details">In Javascript, as in many computer languages, arrays are 0-based. That means that the
                    first item has an index of 0, not 1. Thus in the given code <code>fruit[0]</code> is
                    <code>'apple'</code>, <code>fruit[1]</code> is <code>'banana'</code>, <code>fruit[2]</code> is
                    <code>'grape'</code>, and <code>fruit[3]</code> is <code>'orange'</code>.</p>
