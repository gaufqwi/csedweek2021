    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Welcome. I taught middle school for 20 years. For the last five years of that my
        absolute favorite time of year was <a href="https://www.csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a>. The
        <a
                href="https://hourofcode.com/">Hour of Code</a> was always fun, of course, but I also enjoyed
        providing trivia questions and other activities for our students and faculty. Since I'm not in the classroom
        anymore I don't get to do that now and that makes me sad. So decided to make my own fun and put up some
        CSEdWeek activities right here.</p>

    <p>Each day I plan on offering a set of computer science trivia questions along with some other computer science
        education content. It might be a set of links or a lesson plan or a short text or video tutorial.
        <a href="https://gaufqwi.github.io/csedweek2020/">Last year</a> I did a four day course on creating a
        platformer-type game that runs in your web browser, but this year I'm going to keep things a little more
        open ended. Check back every day to see what's new.</p>
