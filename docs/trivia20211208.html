    <p>Give these trivia questions a try. Click the blurry text to see the answers.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Edsger Dijkstra, Guido van Rossum, and Andrew Tanenbaum are all computer scientists who were either born
            in or spent most of their careers in what country?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">The Netherlands</span></p>

                <p class="details">Dijkstra invented a key algorithm for finding shortest paths through a network
                    (like a road system or a maze). van Rossum invented Python. Tanenbaum did important work with
                    operating systems.</p>
            </div>

        <li>
            What language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto can be extended with packages of code called "gems"?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Ruby</span></p>

                <p class="details">Ruby was developed in Japan in the 1990s. According to the creator,
                    it was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp.</p>
            </div>

        </li>

        <li>
            What decimal number is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 3B?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">59</span></p>

                <p class="details">Hexadecimal is based on powers of 16, so the 3 in 3A represents 3 sixteens instead
                    of three tens. The letters A - F are used to represent digits greater than 9, so A is 10 and B is
                    11. So 3B = 3 &times; 16 + 11 &times; 1 = 48 + 11 = 59.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What list is produced by the Python expression below?

            <pre><code class="language-python">
list(range(2, 11, 3))
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer"><code>[2, 5, 8]</code></span></p>

                <p class="details">The first argument to <code>range()</code> is the first element in the list. The
                    last argument is how much to add each time to get the next element. The second argument is the
                    upper limit of the list, but is never part of the list itself; <code>range()</code> only makes
                    list items strictly less than that value.</p>
