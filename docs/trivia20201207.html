    <ol>
        <li>
            <i>The Imitation Game</i> is a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch about what British computer scientist?
            The name comes from this man's idea of testing if a computer program has artificial intelligence by
            seeing if it can imitate a person in a conversation.

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Alan Turing</span></p>

                <p class="details">Alan Turing is widely considered the father of computer science. His work breaking
                    codes during World War II probably saved many lives. Turing was mistreated during his life because
                    he was gay but in recent years the government of the United Kingdom has apologized, and in 2021 he
                    will be honored by his picture appearing on the new Â£50 note.</p>

        <li>
            What computer language that was invented in 1967 allows you to draw pictures by giving commands like
            <code>FORWARD 50</code> and <code>RIGHT 90</code> to a pen-carrying turtle?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">LOGO</span></p>

                <p class="details">LOGO was designed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon. Early
                    turtles were often robots that rolled on the floor and drew on paper, but now most versions of LOGO
                    use an on-screen turtle.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What short-range wireless technology that is often used to connect mobile phones to other devices is named
            for a 10th century Danish king?

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">Bluetooth</span></p>

                <p class="details">Bluetooth unites phones, computers, speakers, and other devices the same way that
                    King Harald Bluetooth united the various tribes of Denmark. At least that's what the people who came
                    up with the name say.</p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            What number does the following Python code snippet print?

            <pre><code class="language-python">
tot = 0
for n in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    tot = tot + n
print(tot)
            </code></pre>

            <div class="spoiler">
                <p><span class="label">Answer:</span> <span class="answer">15</span></p>

                <p class="details">The loop repeats five times, with the variable <code>n</code> taking the values 1, 2,
                    3, 4, and 5. Each time the value of <code>n</code> is added to <code>tot</code>, which starts at 0.
                    So in the end <code>tot</code> equals 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 which is 15.</p>
